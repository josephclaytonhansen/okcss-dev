                    Loving God and loving our neighbor are the two great commandments (Matthew 22:37-40). Loving and serving our neighbor is how we can follow the example of Jesus Christ. There are always opportunities to serveâ€”in our homes, our communities, and our world. As we serve those around us, we brighten hearts and lift burdens.
